- ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: June 11, 2023, marks the 30th anniversary of the greatest dinosaur movie of all time.
    
  The lifelike movements and behaviors of the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park films were made possible through a technique called "go-motion". This method involved creating physical animatronic models and filming them while they were in motion. The slight motion blur captured during filming gave the dinosaurs a more realistic appearance on screen. The combination of practical effects and CGI in the Jurassic Park franchise revolutionized the way creatures were brought to life in movies, leaving a lasting impact on the world of visual effects. ðŸ¦•ðŸŽ¬
